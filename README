countty is termdown[1] for minimalists. It has no dependencies except for a
POSIX OS and a VT-ish color terminal.

Usage:

    countty [-t <timestamp> [-b]]

        No options make countty count upwards.

        "-t <timestamp>" creates a countdown that ends at the specified time.

        "-b" makes the screen blink in red once the countdown has finished.

    You should combine countty with GNU date:

        countty -t $(date -d '2014-12-24 20:00' +%s)
        countty -t $(date -d 'now + 10 seconds' +%s)
        countty -t $(date -d 'tomorrow 12:00' +%s)
