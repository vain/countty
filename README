NAME
       countty - a counter for your terminal

SYNOPSIS
       countty [-t timestamp [-b n] [-c s]] [-S]

DESCRIPTION
       The  job  of  countty is to count upwards or downwards. It will display
       the time using big LCD-like digits.

       countty is termdown  ⟨https://github.com/trehn/termdown⟩  for  minimal‐
       ists.  It  has no dependencies except for a POSIX OS and a VT-ish color
       terminal.

OPTIONS
       No options make countty count upwards.

       -t timestamp
              Create a countdown that ends at the specified time.

       -b n   Make the screen blink n seconds in red once  the  countdown  has
              finished.  If  n  is -1, the screen will blink about 4 * INT_MAX
              seconds (i.e., “forever”).

       -c s   When the countdown reaches the last s seconds, the display  will
              turn red. Defaults to 10 seconds.

       -S     When  -S  is  specified, countty omits seconds as long as you're
              outside the critical period and as long as the value to be  dis‐
              played is larger than 59 seconds.

EXIT STATUS
       When a countdown has been aborted in some way (e.g., when you send SIG‐
       INT to the process), countty will exit with a status code other than 0.

EXAMPLE
       You should combine countty with date(1), figlet(6), or other tools:

       countty -t $(date -d '2014-12-24 20:00' +%s)
       countty -t $(date -d 'now + 10 seconds' +%s)
       countty -t $(date -d 'tomorrow 12:00' +%s)
       countty -t $(date -d '...' +%s); clear; figlet -tc <<<'PARTY'
