countty is termdown[1] for minimalists. It has no dependencies except for a
POSIX OS and a VT-ish color terminal.

Usage:

    countty [-t <timestamp> [-b <n>]]

        No options make countty count upwards.

        "-t <timestamp>" creates a countdown that ends at the specified time.

        "-b <n>" makes the screen blink n seconds in red once the countdown has
        finished. If n is -1, the screen will blink about 4 * INT_MAX seconds
        (i.e., "forever").

    You should combine countty with GNU date:

        countty -t $(date -d '2014-12-24 20:00' +%s)
        countty -t $(date -d 'now + 10 seconds' +%s)
        countty -t $(date -d 'tomorrow 12:00' +%s)
